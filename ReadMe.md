# Designing to Specification

This is a practise project for designing a website to a specification, allowing me to ensure that I have gained a thorough understanding of the necessary HTML and CSS required to meet design requirements.

### Further Project Information

Design specifications can be found within the design_spec_and_assets directory within the main repository. The desired outcome of the project is to reproduce the design as accurately as possible.
