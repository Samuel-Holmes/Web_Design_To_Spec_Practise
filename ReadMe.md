# Designing to Specification

This is a practise project for designing a website to a specification, allowing me to ensure that I have gained a thorough understanding of the necessary HTML and CSS required to meet design requirements.

### Key Requirements

* Meet the design criteria as accurately as possible

* Ensure responsive design accomodating for multiple screen sizes

* Adress appropriate accessibility concerns such as use of screen readers

* HTML should pass W3C validator checks 

### Video of Completed Site
